# ⚡ Pixora — India's First Vibe-Coded Website Builder

Pixora is a revolutionary platform designed for **creators, students, non-tech users, and small businesses** who have great ideas—but lack the tools to bring them to life. Unlike other rigid platforms, Pixora empowers users to build fully custom, production-ready websites **without writing a single line of code**.

## 🧠 Problem We’re Solving

Every day, thousands of creators struggle to turn their visions into reality. Hiring developers is expensive, coding takes time, and AI platforms like Bolt, Replit, or Framer often produce **generic** or **unreliable output**. Most importantly, they lack **real human support** and **creative flexibility**, making it hard for users to build truly personalized, high-quality websites.
